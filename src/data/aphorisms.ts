    text: "You do not truly know someone until you have disagreed. Conflict reveals what calm conceals. In peace, we meet the persona. In friction, we meet the principle. Disagreement is not dysfunction. It is revelation. Character is not tested by harmony, but by heat. Watch how someone holds themselves when resisted. Does a mask slip? Does a hidden truth emerge? Do they hold on to resentment? Or do they remain anchored in integrity, empathy, respect and communication? In the fullness of time, with enough data, all is revealed. What remains, stands the test of time. These are leadership qualities that cannot be faked. Crisis does not distort. It distills.",
